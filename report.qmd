lex:
The number of years a newborn infant would live if the current mortality rates at different ages were to stay the same throughout its life.

edu:
Education index calculated based on Avg years of schooling, taking values 0 as minimum and 15 as maximum.

```{r}
# maybe we want to do a full join instead of an inner join
