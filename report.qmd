## 1. Introduction

This project compares the relationship between life expectancy at birth and mean years of schooling across countries and years, using data sourced from Gapminder. Life expectancy at birth represents the number of years a newborn would live if current mortality rates did not change throughout its life. Mean years of schooling refers to the average of all education levels completed by adults aged between 25 and 64.

The life expectancy data is compiled from multiple sources. The primary source from 1800–1970 is Gapminder’s version 7 dataset, which is compiled from 100 sources by Klara Johansson and Mattias Lindgren, with estimates to account for major historical events like famines or wars. For 1950–2019, data comes from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). The United Nations World Population Prospects 2022 were used to estimate data from 2020–2100. The mean years of schooling data combines estimates from Lee-Lee (2016) for 1870–1949 (population aged 25–64), Barro-Lee (2018) for 1950–1990 (population aged 25+), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report (2018) for 1991–2017 (population aged 25+).

We hypothesize a moderate to strong positive relationship between mean years of schooling and life expectancy, with higher levels of education correlating with longer life expectancy. This is to be expected, because education is often tied to improved health literacy, better access to healthcare, and improved socioeconomic opportunities, and this connection is supported by The Nation’s Health, a publication of the American Public Health Association (McGill 2016).

## 2. Data Cleaning

Overall, minimal data cleaning needed to be done with these datasets. The mean years of schooling dataset was filtered to exclude years prior to 2000, as many of the years had missing values and sparse coverage. Additionally, Taiwan, South Korea, and Somalia were dropped due to consistently missing education information throughout the entire period. These decisions isolated the analysis to recent, well-documented data, specifically from the years 2000 to 2017.

```{r, fig.height=6}
joined |> 
  filter(year >= 1990,
         is.na(education)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = country)) +
  geom_point(color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Missing Education Data by Country and Year",
    subtitle = "Excluding countries without missing data from 1990-2017",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Country"
  ) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )
```

Figure 1: Missing education data by country and year (1990–2017). Taiwan, South Korea, and Somalia show consistently missing data and were excluded.

## Data Visualization

Aggregated Plot

```{r}
# Aggregate to one row per country
agg_data <- clean |>
  group_by(country) |>
  summarize(mean_edu = mean(education, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean_lex = mean(life_expectancy, na.rm = TRUE))

# Static plot
ggplot(agg_data, aes(x = mean_edu, y = mean_lex)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Mean Years of Schooling vs. Life Expectancy by Country",
       x = "Mean Years of Schooling (2000–2017)",
       y = "Life Expectancy at Birth (2000–2017)") +
  theme_minimal()

```

Animated Plot

```{r}
p <- clean |>
  mutate(continent = countrycode(country, 
                                 origin = "country.name", 
                                 destination = "continent")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = education, y = life_expectancy)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Education vs Life Expectancy Over Time",
       subtitle = "Year: {frame_time}",
       x = "Mean Years of Schooling",
       y = "Life Expectancy at Birth",
       color = "Continent") +
  transition_time(as.integer(year)) +
  ease_aes('linear') +
  theme_minimal()

# Render the animation
anim <- animate(p, renderer = gifski_renderer(loop = TRUE), fps = 10, duration = 8, width = 800, height = 600)

# Save the GIF
anim_save("education_lifeexp.gif", animation = anim)
```

![Education vs Life Expectancy](education_lifeexp.gif)

## Linear Regression

We used the same aggregate data that we coded earlier for the single scatter plot. This data takes the average of each country's life expectancy and the average of their years of education and plots them against each other.

```{r}
reg0 <- lm(mean_lex ~ mean_edu, data = agg_data)
summary(reg0)
plot(mean_lex ~ mean_edu, agg_data, pch = 19, col = "steelblue", 
     main = "Average Life Expectacy vs. Average Years in School per Country",
     xlab = "Average Years in School",
     ylab = "")
mtext("Average Life Expectancy", side = 3, line = 0.5, cex = 0.9, adj = 0)
abline(reg0, col = "steelblue")
```
